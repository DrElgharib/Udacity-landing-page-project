# Landing Page Project

This is a brief demonstration about my submission of Udacity's landing page project of front end web professional track.
This project is for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree program. HTML and CSS starter code provided by Udacity.
project files include styles.css file, app.js file & index.html file.
project was done according to the instructions given with the project and by using some previous knowledge about JS.

## Aim of project
This is a basic landing page that uses Javascript to create a NavBar dynamically and to highlight sections when scrolled. The project uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Table of Contents
Starter code was taken from udacity (https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page).
project files include styles.css file, app.js file & index.html file.
To view the project, please double click on Index file and open it with your browser.
To read view the project skeleton files, please use any editor program you have.

### HTML file:
 1-one extra section was added to the end of the html file according to instructions given.
 2- script link between js and html was added before the end.

### CSS file:
 1-some editing to the font color and size of the heading was applied.
 2- the structure, text-size and padding of the navigation menu were changed to be usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.


### JS file:
 The code consists of three parts that achieve the requirements needed from the project:
 1- the first part defines the main variables and creates the navigation bar and linking them with sections.
    it was started with a function to get information about Sections' id and dataNav and manipulate them to construct the the nav bar and link them with the appropriate section, achieving a smooth scrolling behavior between them on clicking.

 2- the second part is used to set the activity of section that is in view port by looping through all of sections and getting their top position and comparing between which should be active and which should be not.

 3- this file was build with the help of what we was taught in this course, some previous knowledge of some functions and the help of previous examples on W3schools, stackoverflow and MDN site.

## Requirements checked

All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page.
Navigation is built dynamically.
It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures.
